## Pre processing

1. Cleaning
      - Index column is labeld "Id"
      - Invalide Founded_year past current year get set to NaN.
      - Percentage information of "International_students" and "Student_satisfaction" transformed to interval of [0,1].
      - Information of "Student_enrollment" and "Academic_staff" get split in extra columns with suffix "from" and "to".
      - "Academic_staff" containing the value "over-5000" transform into "Academic_staff_from" = 5000, "Academic_staff_to" = ""
      - Duplicate data gets analyzed and filtered out.
2. Train / test split
      - The data is split in 80% Training and 20% Test data

3. Missing value imputation
      - Empty entries in continues data {"CWUR_score","Student_satisfaction"} is filled with the columns mean / median values.
      - Empty entries in categorical data {"Academic_Calender","Campus_setting"} are set to most frequent value
      - Empty entries in "Academic_staff_to" is set to a max of "10000"

4. Normalization
      - Continues data is normalized by its mean an standard error
      {"UK_rank", "World_rank", "CWUR_score", "Minimum_IELTS_score", "International_students", "Student_satisfaction", "Estimated_cost_of_living_per_year_(in_pounds)", "Student_enrollment_from", "Student_enrollment_to", "Academic_staff_from", "Academic_staff_to"}
      - Catigorial data is split by one-hot encoding
      {"Region", "Control_type", "Academic_Calender", "Campus_setting"}
      - columns are ordered alphabetically

5. Convert continuous values to numeric
      - All remaining non numerical columns {'Motto', 'University_name', 'Website'} get dropped.
      - Remaining columns with NaN get dropped. {"Founded_year"}
      - Column "Id" gets dropped.
