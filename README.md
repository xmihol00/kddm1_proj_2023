## SS 2023 - Project 4: Prediction/regression: universities

### Project Ideas

One possible project idea for regression using this dataset is to predict the tuition fees of a university based on its ranking, location, acceptance rate, and other features. Another idea is to analyze the relationship between tuition fees and student satisfaction scores across different universities and see if there is a correlation or a trade-off. A third idea is to compare the performance of different regression models (such as linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest regression, etc.) on this dataset and evaluate their accuracy and error metrics.
